# FaceIt
This project is basically an idea of improving the existing website of online mode of classes with additional features which we felt its required and could bring a huge impact to 
the system. Below we will explain the problems which we are solving by upgrading the current website.

The user registers themselves using a 10 seconds video of them. This is used by the model for recognition. Once the user is registered, he/she can now login by face recognition.
The user can take a picture and this is used by the model trained using the 10 seconds video. Once the user is recognized, the API returns a success message and redirects them to any third party app eg. Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Zoom.

### How the API works
The API's main purpose is to detect the emotional status of the student during online classes. Students attend lots of online classes during a day. So it is possible for the student to get distracted and loose interest. The student is continuosly monitored using the webcam. The student's emotional status is recorded and given as a report to the teacher.
